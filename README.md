eCommerce Project
This is a modern eCommerce web application built using React, Vite, Material-UI, and hosted on Vercel. It integrates the Fake Store API to showcase a variety of products, along with essential features such as category filtering, search functionality, and pagination.

Features
1. Product Listing
Displays a variety of products fetched from the Fake Store API.
Each product includes essential information: title, description, price, image, and rating.

Users can filter products by clicking on categories (e.g., Electronics, Jewelry, etc.).
This feature allows users to quickly narrow down their search to specific product types.
3. Product Details
Clicking on a product redirects users to its detailed page.
The product detail page displays additional information like a description, price, rating, and image.

Users can search for products by name using the search input integrated in the header.
Search results are dynamically filtered and displayed as per the entered keyword.

The product list is paginated for a better browsing experience, making it easy to navigate through large datasets.
Pagination is handled using an efficient system to load and display products in smaller chunks.
6. Responsive Design
The app is fully responsive, optimized for both mobile and desktop views.
Material-UI's responsive grid system ensures that the layout adjusts smoothly for various screen sizes.
